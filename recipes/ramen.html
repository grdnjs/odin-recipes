    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This soul-warming Japanese staple features tender, springy noodles swimming in a rich, complex broth that's been simmered for hours to develop deep umami flavors. Topped with slices of succulent chashu pork, a perfectly soft-boiled egg, fresh scallions, and crisp nori, each bowl offers a harmonious balance of textures and tastes.</p>
